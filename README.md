# DSA
A beginner-friendly repository where I’m learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. This repo includes my notes, solved problems, and step-by-step code as I build my foundation in DSA. It’s a work-in-progress and part of my learning journey toward becoming a better problem-solver and programmer.
